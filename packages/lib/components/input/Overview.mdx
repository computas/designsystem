import { Canvas, Meta, Subtitle, Title } from "@storybook/blocks";

import * as stories from "./input.stories";

<Meta of={stories} />

<Title />
<Subtitle>
  The input component is implemented using only CSS. It is required that the top
  level element is a `label` element, since this enforces good accessibility.
  Below you'll find the different appearances that are currently supported.
</Subtitle>

### Default

<Canvas />

### With placeholder

For accessibility reasons, we never use the `placeholder` attribute on the `input` element.
Instead, please use the `cx-form-field__placeholder` class which provides a placeholder that is placed above the input.

<Canvas of={stories.WithPlaceholder} />

### Invalid

The `cx-form-field--invalid` class gives the form field an invalid appearance.
The invalid styling is also applied automatically through the pseudo selector `:user-invalid`,
which is active when the input is considered invalid, after the user has interacted with the input.

<Canvas of={stories.Invalid} />

### Manually controlling focused styling

The `cx-form-field--focused` class gives the form field a focused appearance.
This can be handy if e.g. you need the form field to have a focused style while e.g. a connected popover is open.
Since the component handles focus styling automatically, this is rarely needed, and is primarily used internally by the web components.

<Canvas of={stories.Focused} />

### Text area

To create an input where the text wraps over multiple lines, simply use an `textarea` instead of an `input`.
The text area is not resizable horizontally.

<Canvas of={stories.TextArea} />

### Without label

If you don't want a label over the input, please provide a label with the utility class `.cx-visually-hidden`.
This way, screen readers will still have a descriptive label associated with the input.

<Canvas of={stories.InputWithoutLabel} />
