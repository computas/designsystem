import { Canvas, Meta, Subtitle, Title } from '@storybook/blocks';

import * as stories from './tooltip.stories';

<Meta of={stories} />

<Title />
<Subtitle>
  Tooltips display informative text when users hover over or focus on an
  element. <br /> When activated, Tooltips display a text identifying an
  element, such as a description of its function.
</Subtitle>

## How to use

Start by importing the component.

```ts
// Web component
import '@computas/designsystem/tooltip';

// React
import { CxTooltip } from '@computas/designsystem/tooltip/react';
```

To display a tooltip in your app, wrap whatever you want to function as your trigger for the tooltip, as well as the tooltip content,
within the tooltip element.
Then, make sure to assign the "slot" prop of the trigger element to "trigger".

Check the code below to see an example.

<Canvas of={stories.Default} />

## Browser support

The popover component uses the new [Anchor Position API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_anchor_positioning/Using)
to position the popover relative to the trigger. This API is not supported in Safari and Firefox as of 22th February 2025. If you want to support
all major browsers, please include the official anchor position API polyfill in the `<head>` of your document:

```html
<script type="module">
  if (!('anchorName' in document.documentElement.style)) {
    import('https://unpkg.com/@oddbird/css-anchor-positioning');
  }
</script>
```
