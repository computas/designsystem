<Subtitle>
	Alerts convey information or warnings to the users and should grab their
	attention to help make informed actions and decisions.
</Subtitle>

## How to get started
Start by importing the component. If you import the web component version, the `<cx-alert>` component is available for use
from the point of the import and further down the application-tree.
<Source
  code={`
// Web component
import '@computas/designsystem/alert';

// React
import { CxAlert } from '@computas/designsystem/alert/react';
`}
language="typescript"
dark
/>

### Local alert

This alert should be placed next to the content it is related to and should not be confused with toast (pops up and disappear) or global alerts (static at the top of the entire web-site). They should help the user correct a problem and then disappear once the problem is corrected.

<Canvas of={stories.AlertInfo} />

<Canvas of={stories.AlertDanger} />

<Canvas of={stories.AlertWarning} />

<Canvas of={stories.AlertSuccess} />
