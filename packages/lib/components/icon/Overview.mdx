The icon component is implemented as a web component where you manually register each icon you want to use in your application.
This ensures that you only include the icons that you need in your bundle. To register an icon for use, please use the `addIcons()`
function with a list of your icons, as such:

<Source
  code={`
import { addIcons } from '@computas/designsystem/icon';
import { bin, download } from '@computas/designsystem/icon/iconRegistry';

addIcons(bin, download);
`}
language="typescript"
dark
/>

The registration of icons is usually done at the root level of your application, and makes the icons globally available.
After registering an icon, use it through the `cx-icon` component. Start by importing the component. If you use the 
web component, you only need to import the component once in your app, preferably at the root level. If you use the
React component, you must import the component in each place you need it.

<Source
  code={`
// Web component
import '@computas/designsystem/icon';

// React
import { CxIcon } from '@computas/designsystem/icon/react';
`}
language="typescript"
dark
/>

Then simply use the component and provide the name of the icon you wish to display:

<Source
  code={`
// Web component
<cx-icon name="download" />

// React
<CxIcon name="download" />
`} language="tsx" dark />

If you try to use an icon that is not registered, the component throws an error.

### Icon overview

<IconGallery>
  {Object.entries(cxIcons)
    .map(([, icon]) => icon)
    .filter((icon) => !!icon.data)
    .map((icon) => (
      <IconItem name={icon.name} key={icon.name}>
        <cx-icon name={icon.name} />
      </IconItem>
    ))}
</IconGallery>

### Sizing

The icon component can be sized through the `size` prop. The prop accepts the same values as our spacing tokens, in other words a number between 1 and 20.
The numbers are on a relative scale, and aligns with our 4px grid. If you want your icon to be 32px, use `size="8"` (since 32 / 4 = 8).

<Canvas of={stories.Sizing} />

### Color

By default, the icon inherits the font color of the container it's within.
If you want to use a custom color, apply a CSS class where you use the `color` property to colorize the icon.

<Canvas of={stories.Color} />
