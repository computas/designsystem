  A dropdown presents a list of options the user can select from and can be used to submit data,
  filter, in a menu and so on. 
</Subtitle>

## How to get started
Start by importing the component. If you import the web component version, both the `<cx-dropdown>` component and `<cx-option>` is available for use
from the point of the import and further down the application-tree.
<Source
  code={`
// Web component
import '@computas/designsystem/dropdown';

// React
import { CxDropdown, CxOption } from '@computas/designsystem/dropdown/react';
`}
language="typescript"
dark
/>

## Default
The default dropdown is an `cx-dropdown` component with a set of `cx-option` child components. Each `cx-option` needs a `value` that contains the
value of the option. If the user selects an option, a `change` event is emitted, containing the selected value (if you use React, the event name is `onChange`).
