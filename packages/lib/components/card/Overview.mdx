<Title />
<Subtitle>
  A card is used to display content and actions on a single topic. They provide a flexible and extensible content container that groups related information in an easily scannable format.
</Subtitle>

## How to get started
Start by importing the component. Once imported, the `<cx-card>` component is ready to use.
``` ts
// Web component
import '@computas/designsystem/card';

// React
import { CxCard } from '@computas/designsystem/card/react';
```

## Default
A card can consist of an **image**, **title**, **subtitle** and **other**. The **title** and **image** can be set as properties, while **subtitle** and **other** use slots for maximum flexibility. To make a card clickable, provide an `href` property which will wrap the entire card in a link.
<Canvas of={stories.Default} />

## Content slots
The card supports several content slots for customization:

- **`subtitle`** - For metadata like time, location, or categories
- **`other`** - For additional content like buttons, tags, or other actions
