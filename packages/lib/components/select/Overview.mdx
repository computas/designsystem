  A select presents a list of options the user can select from and can be used to submit data,
  filter, in a menu and so on. 
</Subtitle>

## How to get started
Start by importing the component. If you import the web component version, both the `<cx-select>` component and `<cx-option>` is available for use
from the point of the import and further down the application-tree.
``` ts
// Web component
import '@computas/designsystem/select';

// React
import { CxSelect, CxOption } from '@computas/designsystem/select/react';
```

## Default
A select consists of a `cx-select` component used within a form-field, with a set of `cx-option` child components. Each `cx-option` needs a `value` that contains the
value of the option. If the user selects an option, a `change` event is emitted, containing the selected value (if you use React, the event name is `onChange`).
<Canvas of={stories.Default} />

## Set a select value
To set a value in the select, please use the `value` prop on the `cx-select` component.
<Canvas of={stories.WithValue} />

## Required
To make the select required, please use the `required` attribute. It's also recommended to provide an invalid text that shows up if the select
enters an invalid state.
<Canvas of={stories.Required} />
