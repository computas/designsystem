The icon component is implemented as a web component where you manually register each icon you want to use in your application.
This is to ensure that you only include the icons that you need in your bundle. To register a an icon for use, please call the `addIcons()`
function with an object containing your icons, as such:

<Source
  code={`
 import { addIcons } from '@computas/designsystem/icon';
 
// import the icon data (SVG string)
import download from '@computas/designsystem/icon/svg/download?raw';

addIcons({
download: { svg: download }
});
`}
language="ts"
dark
/>

The registration of icons is usually done at the root level of your application, and makes the icon available globally.
After registering an icon, use it through the `cx-icon` component. Start by importing the component:

<Source
  code={`
// Web component
import '@computas/designsystem/icon';

// React
import { CxIcon } from '@computas/designsystem/icon/react';
`}
language="ts"
dark
/>

Then simply use the component and provide the name of the icon you wish to display:

<Source
  code={`
// Web component
<cx-icon name="download" />

// React

<CxIcon name="download" />
`} language="ts" dark />

If you try to use an icon that is not registered, the component throws an error.

## Icon overview

<IconGallery>
  {iconNames.map((iconName) => (
    <IconItem name={iconName} key={iconName}>
      <cx-icon name={iconName} />
    </IconItem>
  ))}
</IconGallery>

## Sizing

The icon component can be sized through the `size` prop. The prop accepts the same values as our spacing tokens, in other words a number between 1 and 20.

<Canvas of={stories.Sizing} />

## Color

Use the `color` CSS property to colorize the icons.

<Canvas of={stories.Color} />
