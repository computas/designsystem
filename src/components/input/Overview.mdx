import { Canvas, Meta, Subtitle, Title } from "@storybook/blocks";

import * as inputStories from "./input.stories";

<Meta of={inputStories} />

<Title />
<Subtitle>
  The input component is implemented using only CSS. It is required that the top
  level element is a `label` element. Since this enforces better accessibility.
  Below you'll find the different appearances that are currently supported.
</Subtitle>

### Default

<Canvas />

### Invalid

The `cx-form-field--invalid` class gives the form field an invalid appearance.

<Canvas of={inputStories.Invalid} />

### Text area

<Canvas of={inputStories.TextArea} />
