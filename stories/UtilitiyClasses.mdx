<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>CSS class</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>`.cx-visually-hidden`</td>
      <td>Hides an element visually and takes it out of the document flow, while still being read by a screen reader.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

## Spacing

The design system operates on a 8px grid. We consider 8px as "one unit",
which makes 16px "two units" and so on. We also provide a "half unit" which
is called `05`. All CSS classes and CSS variables that has to do with spacing uses these units to define their size.
