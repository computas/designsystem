# Getting started

Install the library in your application using your preferred package manager.

``` ts
npm install @computas/designsystem
```

## Import the global styles at the top of your application.

This style sheet adds an opinionated CSS reset to your page,
adds all CSS variables to the root of your stylesheet,
and provides the code for the CSS-based components.

``` ts
@import "@computas/designsystem/global-styles.css";
```

## Import the components that you need for your application.

``` ts
React
import { CxSelect } from "@computas/designsystem/select/react";

Web Component (Angular, Vue etc.)
import "@computas/designsystem/select";
```

Finally, use your component in your template.

``` ts
React
<CxSelect>...</CxSelect>

Web Component (Angular, Vue etc.)
<cx-select> ... </cx-select>
```
